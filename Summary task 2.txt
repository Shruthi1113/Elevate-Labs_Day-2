I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI using the supermarket dataset. I imported and cleaned the data, then built visuals such as sales trends, product line performance, payment method distribution, and branch-wise sales. To make the dashboard interactive, I added slicers for City, Branch, Month, and Product Line. Finally, I formatted the dashboard with KPIs and a clean layout for easy analysis.
